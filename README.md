# MergeMyPDF
Simple PDF Merger With DragAndDrop

Created with python 3.11

Needed Packages:
PyQT5, PyPDF2


If You want to create an executable, you need to install pyinstaller as well.
The you can enter "pyinstaller --onefile main.pyw" in your command line to build your executable.

Otherwise you can simply open the main.pyw file with your command prompt or simply double click it.


I recommend using a virtual environment witch all needed packages installed.
You can create an Virtual Environment with following command:

py -m venv <name of your environment>

Afterwards you need to activate your freshly generated environment

Linux: source <your environment>/bin/activate

Windows: Start  <path to your environment>\Scripts\activate.bat
                (Preferred using the command line tool)
                
                
In this env you can install every package needed, as mentioned above.
